# AMPS

AMPS is a python tool for context specific DNA methylation prediction using deep neural network. The precition can be based on the sequence, sequence+annotation or methylation level of neighboring Cytosines.

## Dependencies

1. Tensorflow 2.3.+
2. biopython
3. pandas
4. numpy

## Preprocess

### Mapping WGBS data
If you have the WGBS reads, you should firstly got to the mapping process. The file mapping_scripts.txt shows a sample for the steps:

1. check the quality of the reads
2. trim the reads with low quality
3. mapp the reads using Bismark

## Inputs

AMPS uses three inputs: 
+ DNA Sequence, which should be in fasta format
+ Methylations, which contains the methylation and context information of cytosines. This file is based on the output of methylation extractor of [Bismark](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/tree/master/Docs#optional-genome-wide-cytosine-report-output "wgbs mapping tool") <p><code>chromosome position strand count-methylated count-unmethylated C-context trinucleotide-context</code></p>
+ annotaions, Which is a table containing the annotated functiona element coordination and must be in GF3 format.


### Sequence based

<code>train.py</code> is the module for training the AMPS. AMPS will be trained for the methylation prediction from sequence and annotation. If the annotation file is not passed to the module it will be trained based on the sequence only. Module options:

1. <code> -m, --methylation_file: methylation file address, required</code>
2. <code> -g, --genome_assembly_file: genome sequence file address, must be in fasta format, required</code>
3. <code> -c, --context: context, required</code>
4. <code> -a, --annotation_file: annotation file address</code>
5. <code> -ia, --include_annotation: does the predictor include the annotation in the input? True/False</code>
6. <code> -tr, --train_size: training dataset size, number of inputs for training</code>
7. <code> -ws, --window_size: window size, number of including nucleutides in a window</code>
8. <code> -ct, --coverage_threshold: minimum number of reads for including a cytosine in the training dataset</code>
9. <code> -on, --organism_name: sample name, for saving the files</code>
10. <code> -mcs, --memory_chunk_size: number of inputs in each memory load</code>

As a sample you can run:

<code>python train.py -m ./sample/sample_methylations_train.txt -g ./sample/sample_seq.fasta -a ./sample/sample_annotation.txt -c CG</code>

This module will train a model and save it in the ./models/ directory. The saved model can be loaded and used for the desired set of cytosines. For using the model <code> test.py </code> should be used.

<code> test.py </code> loads the trained model predicts the binary methylation status of all the cytosines listed in the methylation file. The output of prediction is a binary vector. Each element of the vector corresponds to a cytosine in the provided methylation file. This vector will be saved in the ./output/ folder. Module options:


1. <code> -m, --methylation_file: methylation file address, required</code>
2. <code> -mdl, --model_address: trained model address, required</code>
3. <code> -c, --context: context, required</code>
4. <code> -a, --annotation_file: annotation file address</code>
5. <code> -ia, --include_annotation: does the predictor include the annotation in the input? True/False</code>
6. <code> -te, --test_size: testing dataset size, number of inputs for training</code>
7. <code> -ws, --window_size: window size, number of including nucleutides in a window</code>
8. <code> -ct, --coverage_threshold: minimum number of reads for including a cytosine in the training dataset</code>
9. <code> -on, --organism_name: sample name, for saving the files</code>

As a sample you can run:

<code>python test.py -mdl ./models/sample_organismCG.mdl/ -m ./sample/sample_methylations_test.txt -g ./sample/sample_seq.fasta -a ./sample/sample_annotation.txt</code>

### Methylation-profile based

The <code> train_methprofile.py </code> traines a model for cytosine methylation prediction based on its neghbouring Cytosine methylation levels. Module options:

1. <code> -m, --methylation_file: methylation file address, required</code>
2. <code> -c, --context: context, required</code>
3. <code> -tr, --train_size: training dataset size, number of inputs for training</code>
4. <code> -ws, --window_size: window size, number of including nucleutides in a window</code>
5. <code> -ct, --coverage_threshold: minimum number of reads for including a cytosine in the training dataset</code>
6. <code> -on, --organism_name: sample name, for saving the files</code>

An example for running the <code>train_methprofile.py</code> on the sample data can be:

<code>python train_methprofile.py -m ./sample/sample_methylations_train.txt -tr 1000 -c CG</code>

The trained model will be saved on the ./models/ folder. Then by using the <code> test_methprofile.py </code> for a sample of cytosines the binary methylation status can be predicted. This modul's input is profile of a set of cytosines provided in a tab seperated file. Each row of the file should contain the methylation levels of the neighbouring cytosines. For example below is a cytosine profile with a window size of 20 centered on the unknown cytosine(methylation levels of 10 cytosines downstream and 10 cytosines upstream)

<code>0.76190476, 0.67857143, 0.6875    , 0.94366197, 1.        , 0.88235294, 0.6875    , 0.91304348, 0.94444444,1.        , 0.92      , 0.8125    , 0.91666667, 0.81481481, 0.82758621, 0.60606061, 0.95833333, 1.        , 1.        , 0.92307692
 </code>
This can be a row in the cytosine profiles file. The inputs of the <code> test_methprofile.py </code> module are:

1. <code> -p, --prfiles_address: address to the file containing the cytosine profiles. a tab seperated file, each row is the methylation level of neighbouring Cytosines, required</code>
2. <code> -mdl, --model_address: trained model address, required</code>
3. <code> -on, --organism_name: sample name, for saving the files</code>

### GeneBody methylation

The analysis of methylation in the genebody and flanking regions is implemented in the <code> gene_body_analysis.py </code>. This module devides the falnking regions and gene body to a number of bins and then in the genome-wide calculates the average methylation in each bin. Module inputs:

1. <code> -m, --methylation_file: methylation file address, required</code>
2. <code> -g, --genome_assembly_file: genome sequence file address, must be in fasta format, required</code>
3. <code> -c, --context: context, required</code>
4. <code> -a, --annotation_file: annotation file address</code>
5. <code> -ct, --coverage_threshold: minimum number of reads for including a cytosine in the training dataset</code>
6. <code> -bn, --bin_number: number of bins for genebody and flanking regions</code>


The output is two numpy vector each containing the average methylation levels for the bins in the template or nontemplate strands. The numbers come in the order of downstream flanking region, gene body and upstream flanking region.
